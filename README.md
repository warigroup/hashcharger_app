## Run development mode in local environment:

1. Run 'npm install'
2. Run 'npm run dev'
3. access http://localhost:3000/market/stratum.slushpool.com/3333/widgetaccount/password/sha256d/3626a5/ffffff/3626a5/233f5c/ffffff/ffffff/Wz4okAcgswSbB7rm5XD2kf/subuser

* Our public API will not allow you to fetch data from your local machine. Please deploy your app on a server to fully test this application.

## Run production mode on Ngnix server:

1. Run 'npm install'
2. Run 'npm run build'
3. Run 'npm start' or if using pm2 follow next instructions
4. Install pm2 package using 'npm install pm2@latest -g'
4. Run 'pm2 start npm --name "next" -- start'

- Start application's server from applicationâ€™s root folder rather than running it from the production build directory.

- Please note that if you are using a custom server, you will still need to start the custom server from its resident folder rather than running next start from the production build directory (https://github.com/zeit/next.js/wiki/Deployment-on-Nginx's-reverse-proxy)
